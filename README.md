# Metes_web
Metes is a distributed storage project built on IPFS + Crust. Compared with other similar projects, we have implemented end-to-end encryption. Others cannot obtain the real file when the files CID is leaked. Each file corresponds to a decryption key, and the server will not store the user password and file key, which can prevent library collision and resist relevant review
